            <h2>The Personas</h2>
        
            <p>The Abi, Pat, and Tim Personas are identical in several ways:  
                they all have the same job, live in the same place, and all are equally comfortable with mathematics 
                and with the technology they regularly use. 
                Their differences are strictly derived from the gender research on five facets (noted in the sections linked above).
