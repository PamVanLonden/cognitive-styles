      "accessToTech": "Dav has spotty access to reliable devices with reliable internet access, so relies mainly on a mobile phone for internet access. Dav also often uses shared devices or public devices to get work done. Dav went to school in a low-SES community which offered only a basic education. Now Dav rarely chooses to read lengthy or complex text (e.g., newspapers), and some cultural/literary allusions are unfamiliar to Dav. Although the school had a few older computers, it offered little technology education."

So Dav is risk-averse about using unfamiliar technologies that they might need to spend extra time on, even if the new features might be relevant. Dav instead performs tasks using familiar features, because they're more predictable about what Dav will get from them and how much time they will take.",

Dav's caution stems from their privacy/security being particularly at risk because of having to share devices, prior negative experiences with high surveillance, prior experiences with credit card/identity theft, etc.",
